# A/B Testing with ConfigCat

[A/BBY](https://tryabby.dev) is a service for developer focused Feature Flags & A/B Testing. In this Demo you'll be able to use feature flags and A/B tests at the edge.

By A/B testing directly on the server-side, you'll reduce layout shift from client-loaded experiments and improving your site's performance with smaller JavaScript bundles.
